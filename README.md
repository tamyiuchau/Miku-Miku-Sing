# Miku-Miku-Sing
#Features
A complete development diary, produces a midi file that one note is split up into multiple notes (due to the nature of batch processing)
which can be fixed by human intervention.
#Current state:Low priority(GeoConnect goes first)
#Reason
1) Need to wind up a interface -> takes time, new knowledge need to be learnt
1) Don't have much knowledge in signal processing
2) Current libary doesn't (fully) suit the need of realtime processing, may need to wind up some interfaces with libraires writen in c/c++
